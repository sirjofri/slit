\section{Introduction}

\textbf{This is a self-contained literate programming document in \texttt{noweb} style. You can extract the \texttt{Makefile} part with \texttt{notangle} and use the \texttt{make} recipes or use \texttt{noweave} to build the document manually.}

\section{\texttt{slit}}

\subsection{The \texttt{slit} command}

The \texttt{slit} command is equivalent to various \texttt{tangle} tools in other WEB-like literate programming tools. It receives the input file via \texttt{stdin} and outputs the specified code to \texttt{stdout}. The user is responsible for redirecting the output to files.

\texttt{slit} is a simple tool: We need only one parameter, the name of the initial code chunk we want to tangle. All other chunks are included. Additionally we can set the source code format to a supported language with \texttt{-l <language>}. This will affect the line numbers and maybe other features.

\subsection{The \texttt{slit} file}

The \texttt{slit} file is a standard markdown file. Parsing it with various markdown tools should give you a good result, weaving is not neccessarily needed!

\subsection{Compilation and Installation}

\subsubsection{The \texttt{noweb} compatible Makefile}

We want to have a complete document with the compilation process inclusive. So we want to have the \texttt{Makefile} inside our literate program. You can tangle the \texttt{Makefile} with \texttt{notangle -t8 -RMakefile slit.nw > Makefile}, and then you can update it with \texttt{make Makefile}.

First, we define our source files. This way we can combine the tangle process to one \texttt{Makefile} rule.

<<Makefile>>=
sources = 

@

The next step is weaving our documentation. This is a simple process, but we substitute the string \textbf{§{}GITVER{}§} with the correct git version. For the \texttt{Makefile} itself we decided to surround the \texttt{G} with brackets to prevent replacing it, too.

<<Makefile>>=
doc: slit.pdf

slit.pdf: slit.tex
	pdflatex $< && \
	pdflatex $<

slit.tex: slit.nw
	noweave -index -delay $< | \
	sed -e \
	's/§[G]ITVER§/$(shell git describe --always --tags)/g' > $@

@

Then we tangle all our source files. Here we use the same trick as before.

<<Makefile>>=
$(sources): slit.nw
	notangle -t8 -R$@ $< | \
	sed -e \
	's/$$GITVER$$/$(shell git describe --always --tags)' > $@

@

We use a simple hack to tangle the \texttt{Makefile}: Our actual \texttt{Makefile} recipe calls another make process to extract the Makefile content to the file \texttt{Makefile.new}, then the user can rename it to its ``real'' filename.

<<Makefile>>=
Makefile.new: slit.nw
	notangle -t8 -R$(basename $@) $< > $@

Makefile: Makefile.new
	@echo "Makefile tangled. Use \`mv $@ $(basename $@)\`"
